    * able to free form code without checking references
4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    * daily checks to ensure we know both sides of code
#### Conflict Resolution
1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
    * we will reconvine and work through the problems
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    * will bring up info to the instuctor if unable to resolve
